# London-House-Pricing-Statistical-Data-Analysis-and-Amazon-Data-Modelling
In section 1 of this university assingment project I have performed different statistical data analysis using SPSS given the London House Pricing 2023 dataset.

In section 2 of the assingment, we were asked to successfully develope a comprehensive Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and data warehouse for Amazon to satisfy the growing business needs. The following tasks were completed :

Relational Database Design:

Designed a relational database using Chenâ€™s notation or Crow Foot notation to represent the database structure, identifying main entities, attributes, primary keys, and relationships.
Included entities such as Customer, Product, Order, OrderItem, Vendor, and Review, with defined relationships and participation constraints.

Database Implementation:

Populated all tables in the database with meaningful data, including at least 10 records per table.
Wrote MySQL code to implement the database design, using constraints, default values, and ON DELETE clauses as appropriate for the business scenario.

Database Support for Business Scenario:

Explained how the database design supports the business scenario with 3-4 examples of the working database using SQL commands.
